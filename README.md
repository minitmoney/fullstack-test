# Minit Money – Practical Developer Test

Welcome 👋 and thank you for applying!
This test is designed to evaluate your React Native and ReactJS skills, along with your ability to work with Apollo GraphQL, REST (axios), and modern frontend tools.

You will be building both a mobile app and a web dashboard using the designs provided.

## 📱 Mobile App (React Native Expo)

### Required Screens

    1.	Register Screen
    •	Allow new users to register an account.
    •	Use Apollo GraphQL and/or Axios for API calls.
    2.	Login Screen
    •	Authenticate and store token (local storage/secure storage).
    3.	Home Screen
    •	Display a simple welcome and navigation to other screens.
    4.	Send Money Screen
    •	A form to send money (recipient, amount, currency).
    •	Should integrate with an API (you may build your own or mock one).
    5.	Send Money History Screen
    •	Display a list of past transactions.
    •	Pull history from API and render with proper UI states (loading, empty, error).

### Notes

    •	Use React Native Expo.
    •	Use Apollo Client (GraphQL) for data fetching where possible.
    •	Use Axios for REST API calls (if you prefer to mix both).
    •	Implement basic validation on forms (e.g., required fields, amount > 0).

## 💻 Web Dashboard (ReactJS)

    •	Build a transaction dashboard in ReactJS.
    •	Use Chakra UI for layout and styling.
    •	Preferred setup: Vite for fast builds.

### Required Features

    •	Display a list of transactions with:
    •	Transaction ID
    •	Recipient
    •	Amount & Currency
    •	Status
    •	Date/Time
    •	Allow viewing transaction details.

## ⚙️ Backend

### You are free to:

    •	Use a simple Node.js + Apollo GraphQL backend, or
    •	Mock APIs with tools like json-server, or
    •	Implement your own stack (bonus if you use Prisma + MySQL).

We mainly care about frontend implementation, but showing backend skills is a plus.

## ✅ Requirements

    •	Use React Native Expo for the mobile app.
    •	Use ReactJS + Chakra UI + Vite for the web dashboard.
    •	Use Apollo GraphQL for queries/mutations.
    •	Store authentication state securely.
    •	Display transaction history properly.
    •	Commit regularly with clear commit messages — we will review your Git history.

## 📦 Deliverables

    •	GitHub repository with:
    •	/mobile → React Native Expo app
    •	/web → ReactJS dashboard
    •	/server → Your backend implementation
    •	A README with setup instructions (how to run mobile, web, and backend).

## 📝 Evaluation Criteria

### We’ll be looking at:

    •	Code quality (readability, structure, best practices)
    •	UI implementation accuracy (based on designs)
    •	Use of Apollo Client and/or Axios
    •	Commit history (small, meaningful commits)
    •	Error handling & validation
    •	Bonus: Backend with Prisma + MySQL

## Time

The test is designed to take a maximum of 2 days.

## 🚀 Submission

    1.	Push your code to a GitHub repository.
    2.	Share the link with us.
    3.	Make sure your commit history is visible.

## 🛠️ Suggested Tech Stack

    •	React Native Expo
    •	ReactJS + Chakra UI + Vite
    •	Apollo GraphQL
    •	Axios
    •	NodeJS
    •	Prisma + MySQL (optional)

Good luck, and have fun building! 🎉

We’re excited to review your submission.
